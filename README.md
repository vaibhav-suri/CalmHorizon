##Inspiration:
Calm Horizons was inspired by the need for a modern and innovative approach to mindfulness practices. We wanted to create an immersive and calming experience that could transport users to tranquil virtual environments. To achieve this, we used AI-generated skyboxes to create stunning and realistic virtual environments that users can explore and interact with.

##What it does:
Calm Horizons is a VR mindfulness app that allows users to escape to serene virtual environments. The app features three unique environments with custom AI-generated skyboxes and soundscapes. Users can select their preferred environment and engage in mindfulness exercises or simply relax and enjoy the tranquil surroundings. The AI-generated skyboxes provide a sense of immersion and realism that makes the experience truly unforgettable.

##How we built it:
To create Calm Horizons, we utilized the latest AI technology to generate stunning and realistic skyboxes. The app was built using Unity3D, a popular game engine for developing VR applications. We also incorporated various sound effects and animations to enhance the overall experience. The AI-generated skyboxes were created using a combination of deep learning algorithms and procedural generation techniques. This was done using https://skybox.blockadelabs.com/

##Challenges we ran into:
One of the biggest challenges we faced was optimizing the performance of the app. AI-generated skyboxes can be complex and resource-intensive, which can affect the app's overall performance. We had to find a way to balance the visual quality of the skyboxes with the app's performance to ensure a smooth and seamless user experience.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We are proud of creating an app that combines cutting-edge AI technology with mindfulness practices. The AI-generated skyboxes are a unique feature of the app that sets it apart from other VR mindfulness apps. We are also proud of creating an app that provides users with a sense of relaxation and tranquility in a time when stress and anxiety are prevalent.

##What we learned:
During the development of Calm Horizons, we learned the importance of balancing visual quality with performance when developing VR applications. We also learned that AI-generated skyboxes can enhance the realism and immersion of virtual environments, making the overall experience more engaging and memorable.

##What's next for Calm Horizons:
In the future, we plan to expand the app's features by adding more environments and exercises. We also plan to continue to improve the AI-generated skyboxes by incorporating new deep learning algorithms and procedural generation techniques. Our ultimate goal is to provide users with an immersive and engaging VR mindfulness experience that promotes relaxation and well-being.
